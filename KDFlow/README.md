## ✨ Key Features

- **Decoupled Infrastructure** - Using SGLang & FSDP2 for teacher inference and student training respectively.
- **Off-Policy Knowledge Distillation** — Distill from pre-collected teacher hidden states on static datasets.
- **On-Policy Knowledge Distillation** — Student-generated rollout responses are used for teacher forward and distillation training in a closed loop.
- **Cross-Tokenizer Distillation** — Native support for distilling between models with different tokenizers (e.g., Llama → Qwen).
- **Multi-Teacher Distillation** — Route each sample to a domain-specific teacher via `--multi_teacher_config` and `--teacher_routing_key`.
- **SFT Training (Black-box KD)** — Supervised fine-tuning on collected dataset.
- **MultiModal Support** — Support distillation with vision-language models (e.g., Qwen3-VL).
- **Colocate Mode** — Teacher and student models **share the same GPUs** via sleep/wakeup mechanism, maximizing GPU utilization.
- **Teacher on SGLang** — Teacher inference is powered by SGLang Engine, enabling high-throughput prefilling and flexible parallel strategies.
- **Pluggable KD Algorithms** — Built-in support for Vanilla KD and DSKD (Dual-Space Knowledge Distillation), with easy registration of custom algorithms.
- **Multiple Loss Functions** — Torch compiled KL divergence, Reverse KL divergence, JS divergence, Adaptive KL (AKL), etc.
- **Chunked Loss** — Memory-efficient loss computation that processes logits in small token chunks, avoiding full logits materialization (enabled via `--chunked_loss_size`).
- **LoRA Support** — Optional LoRA fine-tuning for the student model.
- **Wand&b Integration** — Built-in wand&b logging for experiment tracking.
- **High Training Efficiency** — Achieves **1.4x to 6x** faster distillation compared to mainstream knowledge distillation frameworks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/songmzhang/KDFlow.git
cd KDFlow
pip install -e ./
# install flash attention after torch installation
pip install flash_attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation
```

Use the prebuilt Docker image from Docker Hub (**recommended**):

```bash
docker pull songmzhang/kdflow:sgl0512-torch211-cu129
```

> To support Qwen3.5, please use the latest version of SGLang which supports transformers v5.3.0.

> Older `sgl059-torch291-cu128` images are kept as legacy.
>
> ⚠️ **VLM users:** `sglang==0.5.9` has a known VLM compatibility bug tracked in [sglang#19335](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/19335) and [kdflow#9](https://github.com/songmzhang/KDFlow/issues/9). For source installs, please pin `sglang>=0.5.10`.

### Off-Policy Knowledge Distillation
LLMs:
```bash
bash ./examples/off_policy_kd/run_qwen3_30b_a3b_to_4b.sh
```
VLMs:
```bash
bash ./examples/off_policy_kd/run_qwen3_vl_30b_a3b_to_4b.sh
```

### On-Policy Knowledge Distillation
LLMs:
```bash
bash ./examples/on_policy_kd/run_qwen3_30b_a3b_to_4b.sh
```
VLMs:
```bash
bash ./examples/on_policy_kd/run_qwen3_vl_30b_a3b_to_4b.sh
```

### Multi-Teacher Distillation

Multi-teacher distillation supports both off-policy and on-policy KD. Provide a JSON config that maps routing keys to teacher model paths, and make sure each training sample contains a `teacher_routing_key` value matching one of those keys.

```json
{
    "math": "Qwen3/Qwen3-14B",
    "code": "Qwen3/Qwen3-14B"
}
```

Off-policy:
```bash
bash ./examples/multi_teacher_distillation/run_multi_teacher_off_policy_distillation.sh
```

On-policy:
```bash
bash ./examples/multi_teacher_distillation/run_multi_teacher_on_policy_distillation.sh
```

See the [Multi-Teacher KD guide](docs/user_guide/multi_teacher_kd.md) for details.

### Cross-Tokenizer Knowledge Distillation

#### Off-Policy

Use SimpleCrossTokenizerKD (suggested):
```bash
bash ./examples/cross_tokenizer_kd/run_qwen3_30b_a3b_to_llama3_2_3b_offpolicy_simple_ctkd.sh
```

or DSKD:

```bash
bash ./examples/cross_tokenizer_kd/run_qwen3_30b_a3b_to_llama3_2_3b_offpolicy.sh
```

#### On-Policy

Use SimpleCrossTokenizerKD (suggested):
```bash
bash ./examples/cross_tokenizer_kd/run_qwen3_30b_a3b_to_llama3_2_3b_onpolicy_simple_ctkd.sh
```

or DSKD:

```bash
bash ./examples/cross_tokenizer_kd/run_qwen3_30b_a3b_to_llama3_2_3b_onpolicy.sh
```

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

```bash
bash ./examples/sft/run_qwen3_4b.sh
```

## 🔑 Design Highlights

### GPU Co-location via Sleep/Wakeup

KDFlow enables teacher and student to **share the same GPUs** through a sleep/wakeup mechanism:

1. **Teacher phase**: Teacher model weights are loaded on GPU, student optimizer states are offloaded to CPU.
2. **Student phase**: Student optimizer states are reloaded to GPU, teacher model weights are offloaded to CPU.

This allows running large teacher models (e.g., 200B+ parameters) on the same hardware as the student without requiring separate GPU pools.

### Hidden States Transfer via Shared Memory

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/cost.png" alt="Knowledge transfer cost" width="80%">
</p>

Instead of transferring full teacher logits (which can be enormous for large vocabularies), KDFlow:

1. Extracts **hidden states** from the teacher's last layer via SGLang.
2. Transfers them to the student via **shared memory** (zero-copy).
3. Computes teacher logits **on the student side** using only the teacher's `lm_head` weights.

This dramatically reduces memory and communication overhead.

### Token-Based Teacher Load Balancing

The `TeacherActorGroup` uses a **greedy token-based load balancing** strategy to distribute micro-batches across teacher actors, ensuring even workload distribution when sequence lengths vary.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement

KDFlow is built upon the shoulders of outstanding open-source projects. We sincerely thank:

- [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) — We deeply appreciate its support for extracting hidden states from model inference and its exceptional inference efficiency, which are critical to KDFlow's teacher inference pipeline.
- [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF) — We gratefully adopt its well-designed abstractions for model wrapping and distributed training strategy, which form the foundation of our training infrastructure.
- [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) — We appreciate its elegant implementation of Ray placement group initialization and the weight update mechanism for SGLang, which greatly inspired our design of on-policy distillation.
